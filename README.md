# BoggleCheater
Python script with GUI for entering boggle board and then listing all possible words. Currently ordered by point values given to each letter. GUI automatically jumps to next entry box after letter is entered. Enter compiles list.

Meant for personal use, not full release.

Features I may add:
  - input cleaning
  - double/triple letter/word support
  - path display
  - larger display of best word that advances with key press
  - order words by point values or word length
